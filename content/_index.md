# DualMCU Introduction - MicroPython 


-------------------------------------------
Welcome to the practice repository for the <a href="https://github.com/UNIT-Electronics/DualMCU" target="_blank">UNIT DUALMCU development board</a>, a powerful platform that combines the capabilities of ESP32 and RP2040 microcontrollers. This repository is designed to provide a step-by-step guide for exploring and developing applications with this board, covering basic concepts to intermediate projects.

The main objective of this repository is to provide a comprehensive and structured resource for those who wish to learn how to harness the capabilities of DUALMCU for a wide range of practical applications. Each practice focuses on specific aspects such as programming LEDs, sensors, actuator control, monitoring systems, and wireless communication, among others.

Before diving into the proposed practices, it is crucial to familiarize yourself with the features and functionalities offered by the UNIT DUALMCU development board. This will enable you to make the most of its capabilities. The following section provides a general overview of its characteristics.
